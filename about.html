Riot Games was founded in 2006 to develop, publish, and support the most player-focused games in the world.
In 2009, we released our debut title, League of Legends, to worldwide acclaim. League has gone on to be the
most-played PC game in the world and a key driver of the explosive growth of esports.
As League enters its second decade, we’re continuing to evolve the game while delivering
new experiences to players with Teamfight Tactics, Legends of Runeterra, VALORANT, League of Legends: Wild Rift,
and multiple work-in-progress titles. We’re also expanding the world of Runeterra through multimedia projects across music, 
comic books, board games, and the upcoming animated series Arcane.</b></pre></div>
